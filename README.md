This project utilizes scikit-learn and the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to accurately classify movie review sentiments as positive or negative. The IMDb movie reviews dataset was used for training (sentiment analysis.py).
Furthermore, an algorithm using Naive Bayes has been written from scratch, which can be utilized for text classification purposes (text classifier.py)
